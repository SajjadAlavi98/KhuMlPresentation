<h3>A peek Into Reinforcement Learning - Tensorflow  </h3>

* This was a short presentation about reinforcement learning, as well as a brief introduction to the TensorFlow library and some examples of how to work with this useful and powerful library.

* After a simple explanation about this library in the (https://github.com/SajjadAlavi98/KhuMlPresentation/blob/main/TF101.ipynb) file, we started to explain about neural networks. We have a good example in this field in the (https://github.com/SajjadAlavi98/KhuMlPresentation/blob/main/TF_TrainModel.ipynb) file regarding training a neural network model in the TensorFlow library.

* Also about linear regression (https://github.com/SajjadAlavi98/KhuMlPresentation/blob/main/LinearRegressionTF.ipynb) and a practical example in the field of house price pridiction according to house price data in Boston (https://github.com/SajjadAlavi98/KhuMlPresentation/blob/main/TensorFlow_housepridiction.ipynb).

* Finally, the simulation of an interactive environment in the field of reinforcement learning using the Q-learning algorithm was described under the title of how a reinforcement learning program works(https://github.com/SajjadAlavi98/KhuMlPresentation/blob/main/Taxi_env.ipynb).
